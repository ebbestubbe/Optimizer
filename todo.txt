simplex initialization: make sure that the points are moved towards the middle, so a starting point at the edge doesnt make redundant points

CLIPPING:
	clipping points to remain within boundaries: transfer to an obligation in the optimization function?
	abscraction of points - values?

how to handle functions only defined at integers? 

OBSERVERS:
	Common interface/superclass, such that all observers can 'pass' easily
	Print progress along the way
	
FUNCTIONS:
	Common interface/superclass
	contour plotting
	
OPTIMIZERS:
	Common interface/superclass
		observers append/notify
	normalize points/values vs point/value naming, maybe to val/var?
	initialize starting vars randomly
	adding individual points to starting vars
	
RESULTS:
	Common way to show the results, with comparison between functions and optimizers
	Make gifs of the in-between results
	Make a 'result shower' agent, drawing the pictures etc.
	Image of the magnitude of the error


way down the line:
	parallelization
	use gfxcard
