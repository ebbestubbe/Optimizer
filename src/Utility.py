#Utility file, with random functions that dont really fit elsewhere.

#make the figures required:
    #As a function of iteration number(Handle zoom levels in an appropriate way:
        #Function value
        #absolute change
        #relative change
        #labels
        #simplex: log and plot what operation was performed
        
    #function plot(handle zoom levels)
        #Contour plots
            #whole function domain
            #zoom around the minimum
        #contour plot with points tried
            #Whole function domain
            #zoom around all points
            #zoom around minimum
        #Gif of the points tried
            #Whole domain
            #zoom

    #time spent where
        # iteration number / time spent in each method
        # histogram, / divided by method type
    
    #Saving all of this in a common file/format perhaps.
